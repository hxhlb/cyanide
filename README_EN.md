<p align="center">
  A sideloadable iOS tweak runner built on the DarkSword kernel read/write primitive.

</p>

Cyanide combines the DarkSword kernel exploit chain with an Installer-style
interface and RemoteCall-based SpringBoard tweaks. It is not a traditional
jailbreak: most runtime tweaks are applied from the app and remain active only
for the current SpringBoard session, while a smaller set of tools intentionally
write persistent files or preferences.

This repository is the actively developed [`hxhlb/cyanide`](https://github.com/hxhlb/cyanide)
fork of the original [`zeroxjf/cyanide`](https://github.com/zeroxjf/cyanide)
project (formerly `cyanide-ios`). Patreon integration has been removed; all
installable built-in tweaks are available without account linking.

## Compatibility

The current exploit window is:

- iOS/iPadOS 17.0 through 18.7.1
- iOS/iPadOS 26.0 through 26.0.1
- A19 and M5 devices are not supported

The kernel bugs used by Cyanide, `CVE-2025-43510` and `CVE-2025-43520`, were
fixed in iOS/iPadOS 18.7.2 and 26.1. SpringBoard private APIs also vary between
releases, so an OS version being inside the exploit window does not guarantee
that every tweak works on that version or device.

## Install

Download the latest unsigned IPA from
[`GitHub Releases`](https://github.com/hxhlb/cyanide/releases/latest), then sign
and install it with your preferred sideloading tool.

## Highlights

### Tweak runner

- Installer-style package browser, queue, settings, logs, and local file sharing
- Compatibility groups that identify conflicting tweaks and prevent them from
  being queued together
- Kernel read/write setup, app sandbox escape, and SpringBoard RemoteCall support
- Runtime cleanup and session recovery for supported tweaks
- QuickLoader and RepoTweaks for local or repository-hosted JavaScript tweaks

Some packages are experimental, device-specific, or intentionally disabled
while incomplete. The tables describe feature scope, not verified support on
every OS release. The in-app package description and warning are the source of
truth for each feature. See [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for recent
user-visible changes and
[`docs/TWEAK_COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/TWEAK_COMPATIBILITY.md) for system-resource
ownership and conflict details.

## Safety

Cyanide uses a kernel exploit, private APIs, and runtime method replacement.
SpringBoard restarts, UI freezes, partial application, or a device reboot are
possible, especially on untested OS builds.

Read each package warning before applying it. Runtime tweaks are generally
restored by Cyanide's Clean Up action or by respringing, but tools that edit
system files, MobileGestalt values, or preferences can persist across a
respring or reboot. Keep backups of important data and do not test on a device
you cannot restore.

## Build

Requirements:

- macOS with a compatible Xcode and iPhoneOS SDK
- `xcbeautify` is optional; the build script falls back to raw `xcodebuild`
- `ldid` is required only for the VPhone packaging path

Build an unsigned device IPA:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

The script writes `build/Cyanide-<version>.ipa` and updates
`build/Cyanide.ipa` to point to the latest build.

For a simulator build:

```sh
SDK=iphonesimulator ./scripts/build.sh
```

## JavaScript Tweaks

QuickLoader imports local `.js` files. RepoTweaks loads JavaScript packages
from HTTPS JSON repositories. Scripts run with powerful RemoteCall helpers, so
only use scripts and repositories you trust.

Scripts that change in-memory SpringBoard state should expose a synchronous
`globalThis.cleanup` function:

```js
globalThis.cleanup = function () {
  r_msg2_main(view, "setHidden:", 0);
  clearInterval(timer);
};
```

Cyanide invokes `cleanup()` when a supported script is disabled, removed, or
stopped during session cleanup. The function should restore only state owned by
that script and finish quickly. It cannot automatically reverse persistent file
or system changes.

## Contributing

Bug reports and focused pull requests are welcome:

- [Report a bug](https://github.com/hxhlb/cyanide/issues/new)
- [Open a pull request](https://github.com/hxhlb/cyanide/pulls)

When changing a private SpringBoard API path, include the tested device and OS
version. Keep compatibility fallbacks scoped because behavior differs sharply
between iOS releases.
